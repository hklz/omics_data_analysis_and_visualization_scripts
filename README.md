## Sample Name Update

In the recent update of our project, we have renamed several sample names to better reflect their characteristics and classification. Below is the list of old names and their corresponding new names:

- **MGT** has been renamed to **MG0**
- **MGI** has been renamed to **MG19**
- **MGE** has been renamed to **MG24**
- **MGF** has been renamed to **MG28**
- **MGH** has been renamed to **MG32**
- **MGS** has been renamed to **MG38**
- **MGN** has been renamed to **MG54**
- **MGD** has been renamed to **MG70**

This renaming is aimed at enhancing clarity and efficiency in project management. Please note that in all subsequent documentation, code comments, and reports, the new sample names will be used.
